# Diversity-Scholarships
Comprehensive list of diversity scholarships including travel stipend opportunities and student discounts.

Here is a list of scholarship and travel stipend opportunities to attend tech conferences around the globe. I also included a few links for educational workshops. Please look through each event and be sure to watch for the upcoming deadlines, some are as soon as tomorrow, February 22nd.

Most of these events are based in the US and throughout Europe. However, I can research for those hosted in other countries. If you have an event that you want to attend but aren’t sure if there is a scholarship available, please reach out to me and I will do my best to get one established. I can also refer you to a sponsor but please note sponsorship isn’t a guarantee.
